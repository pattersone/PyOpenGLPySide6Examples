# PyOpenGLPySide6Examples
This can get you started on the basics of OpenGL and shaders in a PySide6-based Qt environment.

pip install numpy
pip install pyside6

(If you've been in the Technical Art and Direction course, you likely have a Python venv with previous and can just install PyOpenGL):
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate

(or possibly just 'pip install PyOpenGL' if that seems to cause issue).

These should function on MacOS Sonoma as well as Rocky Linux 8.  Likely others but I haven't checked.
